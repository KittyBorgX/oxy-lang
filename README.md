Yet another compiler, written in python

### What's this? 
Background: For quite a while now, I've been trying to implement a compiler in the rust programming language but as I now realise, the creative part of it dissapeared for me due to idiomatic code and best practices. Since I can't take out two birds with one stone, I decided to implement a compiler in python. Why python, you may ask? Well, I've been aquainted with python for many years now and due to the permissive type system, I can draw out code in the way I want to without worrying much about the types or memory related issues due to python being a garbage collected language. It certainly is much less feasable and much much slower when compared to rust or any other language but I want to implement a compiler and focus on performance and reliability later. 
This repository and the language in it are a pure experiment of my creative side without idiomatic code. I will rewrite this in rust or a similar language when it turns into a serious project. Till that time, I want to experience building different parts of a compiler and various unique features and approach language development in a creative approach without worrying about best practices. 

### Note: 
I'd recommend not to use this compiler for anything serious since its purely an experiment.
